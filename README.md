# TeleportUnlimited

A Torchlight 2 mod to allow Embermages to teleport anywhere.

By default, the Frost Phase (Teleport) ability is limited to locations where the game can find a path.  This mod switches the flag in the game settings to allow the caster to teleport anywhere, just like in Diablo 2.
